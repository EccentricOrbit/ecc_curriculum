# Mid-Season Remix Challenge

Are you ready to put your remixing skills to the test? In this challenge, your team will create a remixed composition using the provided sound library and TunePad.

## Challenge Guidelines
- Your remixed composition should be between 2 and 4 minutes long
- Teams can consist of 1-4 people
- Each team member should contribute to the creative process and the final composition

So, gather your squad, and work together to create a remix that will let your creativity shine

## Remixing Process: A Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Explore the Sound Library 
- Get to know the provided sound library, which includes:
  - Drum kits (various styles and genres)
  - Synths and pads (for melodies and atmospheres)
  - Loops (pre-made musical phrases)
  - FX and ambience (sound effects and background textures)
- Test out different combinations and manipulations of these sounds to find what works best for your remix

- Remember: You must use at least 3 elements from each category in your final remix

### Step 2: Choose a Starting Point 
- Pick a pre-existing TunePad project from the provided collection to serve as the foundation for your remix
- Study the project's structure, elements, and identify areas where you can add your own creative touch

### Step 3: Remix and Manipulate 
- Add at least 5 different elements from the sound library into your remix
- Get creative with processing and manipulating these sounds using techniques like:
  - Layering (combining multiple sounds)
  - Filtering (adjusting frequency content)
  - Pitch-shifting (changing the pitch of a sound)
  - Time-stretching (altering the length of a sound without changing its pitch)

- Challenge yourself: Use at least 3 of these techniques in your remix to showcase your skills

### Step 4: Showcase Your Technical Skills 
- Add at least three different TunePad features into your remixed composition, such as:
  - Parameters (to control sound properties)
  - Functions (to create reusable code snippets)
  - Loops (to repeat musical phrases)
- Make sure your code is efficient and easy to read â€“ this will impress the judges!

- **Don't forget:** Your code should include at least 1 custom function and 2 loops to show your technical abilities.
