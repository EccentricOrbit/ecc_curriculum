- **Team Size:** Teams can consist of 1-4 members(Let's determine this).
- **Submission Deadline:** [Insert Date]

## Remix Guidelines

1. **Sonic Palette: A Diverse Selection** We've curated a diverse selection of sounds and drum loops spanning various genres, providing you with a rich sonic palette to work with. 

   - Hip-Hop Samples
   - Country Melodies
   - Electronic Dance Music (EDM) Rhythms

2. **Explore the Sound Library:** We've curated an extensive sound library featuring:
   - Drum Kits: A diverse range of drum samples spanning different genres, including acoustic and electronic sounds.
   - Synthesized Sounds: A collection of synthesized melodies, basslines, and atmospheric pads.
   - Vocal Samples: A selection of vocal snippets, chants, and spoken word samples.
   - Loops: Pre-made musical phrases to incorporate into your remix.

4. **Personal Expression:** While the provided sound library offers a rich foundation, we encourage you to also incorporate your own recorded sounds or samples into your remix. However, be mindful of copyright considerations. If you choose to use external sounds, provide proper attribution and ensure you have the necessary permissions(Is that necessary or can we use something free, how can we tell).

5. **Mandatory Elements:** Your remix must include:
   - At least one drum beat from the provided drum kits.
   - A minimum of one sound effect or ambience element.
   - one custom function, what technical requirements: call one functions from the provided ones.

4. **Creative Expression:** Get creative with processing and manipulating the provided sounds using techniques such as:
   - Layering (combining multiple sounds)
   - Filtering (adjusting frequency content)
   - Pitch-shifting (changing the pitch of a sound)
   - Time-stretching (altering the length of a sound without changing its pitch)

5. **Technical Showcase:** Include at least three different TunePad features into your remixed composition, such as:
   - Parameters (to control sound properties)
   - Loops (to repeat musical phrases)
   - User-defined functions (to create reusable code snippets)

6. **Code Quality:** Ensure your code is efficient, well-organized, and easy to read. Comment your code to explain your thought process and creative decisions.

7. **Composition Length:** Your remixed composition should have a duration between 2 and 4 minutes.

## Scoring Criteria

Your remixed projects will be evaluated by our expert panel of judges based on the following criteria:
