# Welcome to TunePad

people who love music and are interested in the intersection of music and coding. Maybe you’re an aspiring musician who wants to know more about coding and what it can do. Or maybe you already know a little about coding, and you want to expand your creative musical horizon. Or maybe you’re a total beginner in both. Regardless of your starting point, TunePad is designed for you to learn about music and coding as mutually reinforcing skills. Code gives us an elegant language to think about musical ideas, and music gives us a context within which code makes sense and is immediately useful. Together they form a powerful new way to create music that will be interconnected with digital production tools of the future. 

Here are two important things to know before we get started:

* TunePad is free for everyone to use. It was created at Northwestern University with funding from the National Science Foundation.
* TunePad does **not** make money from advertising, and it will **never** sell your data or information.

# What is Python?
With TunePad you’ll learn how to create your own music using a computer programming language called [Python](https://www.python.org). Python is a general purpose language first released in the 1990s that is now one of the most widely-used languages in the world. Python is designed to be easy to read and write, which makes it a popular choice for beginners. It’s also fully featured and powerful, making it a good choice for professionals working in fields as diverse as data science, AI, web development, the arts, and video game development. Because Python has been around for decades, it runs on every major computer operating system. TunePad even uses a version of Python that runs directly inside of your web browser without the need for any special software installation.

Unlike many other common beginner programming languages, Python is “text-based”, which means that you type code into an editor instead of dragging code blocks on the computer screen. This makes Python a little harder to learn than other beginner languages, but it also greatly expands what you can do.

# Writing Your First Program
In TunePad you can program different musical instruments using Python code. The program below plays four notes on a piano keyboard. Press the ▶ button below to hear how it sounds. Code in TunePad is interactive, which means that you can change the code even while music is playing.


# Practice with a Mystery Melody
Time to practice fixing syntax errors.
See if you can fix all of the syntax errors in this project to reveal the mystery melody.
