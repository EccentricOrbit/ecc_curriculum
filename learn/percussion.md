Working with rhythm, you’ll come across lots of terminology for different percussion instruments and sounds. 
Here’s a quick rundown on some of the most common drum sounds that you’ll work with in digital music.

| Drum&nbsp;Names | Description | TunePad&nbsp;Note Number |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| Kick or bass drum | The kick drum (or bass drum) makes a loud, low thumping sound. Kicks are commonly placed on beats 1 and 3 in rock, pop, house, and electronic dance music. In other genres like hip-hop and funk, kick drums are very prominent, but their placement is more varied. | 0 and 1 |
| Snare | Snare drums make a recognizable sharp staccato sound that cuts across the frequency spectrum. They are built with special wires called snares that give the drum its unique snapping sound. Snare drums are commonly used on beats 2 and 4. |	2 and 3 |
| Hi-Hat | The hi-hat is a combination of two cymbals sandwiched together on a metal rod. A foot pedal opens or closes the cymbals together. In the closed position the hi-hat makes a bright tapping sound. In the open position the cymbal is allowed to ring out. Hi-hats have become an integral part of rhythm across almost all genres of popular music. | 4 (closed)<br>5 (open) |
| Low, Mid, High Tom | Tom drums (tom-toms) are cylindrical drums that have a less snappy sound than the snare drum. Drum kits typically have multiple tom drums with slightly different pitches (such as low, mid, and high). | 6, 7, 8 |
| Crash Cymbal | A large cymbal that makes a loud crash sound, often used as a percussion accent. | 9 |
| Claps and shakers | Different TunePad drum kits include a range of other percussion sounds common in popular music including various claps, shakers, and other sounds. | 10 and 11 |

# 808 Drum Kit
Released in the early 1980s, the Roland 808 drum machine was a hugely influential sound in early hip-hop music (and other genres as well). The 808 used electronic synthesis techniques to create synthetic replicas of drum sounds like kicks, snares, hats, toms, cowbells, and rim shots. Tinkerers would also open up the 808s and hack the circuits to create entirely new sounds. Today 808s usually refers to low, booming bass lines that were first generated using tweaked versions of the 808’s kick drums. TunePad’s default drum kit uses samples that sound like the original electronically synthesized 808s.

# Selecting TunePad Instruments
When you’re coding in a TunePad cell, the sound that your code makes will depend on the instrument you have selected. If you’re coding a rhythm, you can choose from several different drum kits including an 808 and rock kits. You can change the instrument by clicking on the selector shown below.
