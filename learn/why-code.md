Why would anyone want to make music using Python code? Aren't there better tools out there?
To help answer this question, here are four quick reasons why it might make seense to learn about music and code together.

# Reason 1: Code is a powerful language for thinking about music

One answer is that code gives us an elegant **language** to think about musical ideas. Music is algorithmic in nature—it’s full of mathematical relationships, logical structure, and recursive patterns. 
Unfortunately, music notation doesn't always capturing this.

Code, on the other hand, is a language specifically designed to capture mathematical relationships, logical structure, and recursive patterns. For example, think about the stuttered hi-hat patterns are a common feature of popular music. These patterns are tedious to write with sheet music, but they can be captured in an elegant way with a few lines of Python code.
```python
for i in range(6):
    playNote(4, beats = 0.5)
    
for i in range(4):
    playNote(4, beats = 0.25)
```
What’s interesting about this example is that it's **parameterized**. That means that we can easily create variation by adjusting the different numbers involved. We can change how many notes we play, how fast those notes go by, and even the dynamics and tone of thoe notes.

# Reason 2: Like it or note, music is already defined by code
Looking across the modern musical landscape, it’s clear that music is created with the help of sophisticated computer software. It’s hard to overstate how much software has shaped the sound of music in the 21st century. Computers have gotten to a point where they are cheap enough, fast enough, and capacious enough to do real-time audio editing. We can convert sound waves into digital information and hear the effects of our changes in real time. These tools didn’t just appear out of nowhere. They were constructed by huge teams of software engineers writing code—millions of lines of it. As an example, TunePad was created with over 1.5 million lines of code written in over a dozen computer languages such as Python, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Regardless of how you feel about the digital nature of modern music, it’s not going away. Learning to code will help you understand a little more about how all of this works under the hood. More to the point, it’s increasingly common for producers to write their own code to manipulate sound. Learning to code can give you more control and help expand your creative potential.

# Reason 3: Code gives us new creative possibilities with music
Along with any new language comes new creative possibilities. For example, live coding is an emerging form of musical performance art in which performers write computer code to generate music in real time for [live audiences](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/style/live-code-music.html).

The history of innovation in music has always been entwined with innovation in technology. Whether we’re talking about Franz Liszt in the 19th century, who pioneered the persona of the modern music virtuoso based on technological breakthroughs of the piano, or DJ Kool Herc in the 20th century, who pioneered hip-hop with two turntables and a crate full of funk records in the Bronx, technologies have created new opportunities for musical expression that have challenged the status quo and given birth to new genres.

# Reason 4: Learning to code is useful for many other things
Python is one of the most powerful, multi-purpose languages in the world. It’s used to create web servers and social media platforms as much as video games, animation, and music. It’s used for research and data science, politics and journalism. Knowing a little Python gives you access to powerful machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI / ML) techniques that are poised to transform most aspects of human work, including in creative domains such as music. Learning a little Python won’t make you a software engineer, just like learning a few guitar chords won’t make you a performance musician. But it’s a start down a path. An open door that was previously closed, and a new way of using your mind and a new way of thinking about music. 

# Oh, yeah. What about AI?
Great question! When we first started making TunePad, the idea that you could generate full-length songs in any genre with a short text prompt was science fiction. Now, of course, fiction has become reality. As we mentioned above, Python is one of the most popular tools that developers can use to build AI systems. And it's still important, maybe more important than ever, for humans to learn how to make original music. We'd be lying if we told you we could predict the future, but we do know that human creativity and self-expression aren't going away.
