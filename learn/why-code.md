# Why Music and Coding?

More and more code will be used to produce music, to compose music, and even to [perform music for live audiences](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/style/live-code-music.html). Digital production tools such as Logic, Reason, Pro Tools, FL Studio, and Ableton Live are complex software applications created with millions of lines of code written by huge teams of software engineers. With all of these tools you can write code to create custom plugins and effects. Beyond production tools, live coding is an emerging form of musical performance art in which Information Age DJs write computer code to generate music in real time for live audiences.

In other ways, we’re still on the cusp of a radical transformation in the way that we use code to create music. The history of innovation in music has always been entwined with innovation in technology. Whether we’re talking about Franz Liszt in the 19th century, who pioneered the persona of the modern music virtuoso based on technological breakthroughs of the piano, or DJ Kool Herc in the 20th century, who pioneered hip-hop with two turntables and a crate full of funk records in the Bronx, technologies have created new opportunities for musical expression that have challenged the status quo and given birth to new genres. We don’t have the Franz Liszt or DJ Kool Herc of coding yet, but it’s only a matter of time before the coding virtuosos of tomorrow expand the boundaries of what is possible in musical composition, production, and performance.
