# Final Project
<img src="/images/splash/final-splash.png" alt="Floating headphones" width="300" style="margin: 2rem;">

It’s time to put everything you’ve learned together to create an original musical composition with Python code! Your project should have 4 parts, each in its own TunePad cell:

* Rhythm (drums)
* Harmony (chords)
* Melody or Arpeggios
* Artwork, lyrics, or a description of your project.

You’ll also showcase everything you’ve learned about Python:

* Comments so your code is easy to understand
* Variables
* `playNote` functions with different note durations
* `rest` functions
* Loops
