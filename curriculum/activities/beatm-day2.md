# Warmup: Fixing Syntax Errors
In this activity, you'll learn about *syntax errors* in Python code and how to fix them.
You'll also get to practice fixing syntax errors in a TunePad project to reveal a mystery melody.

# Drum Names and Numbers
* TunePad uses numbers to represent different notes and drum sounds.
* Try clicking on each different drum to hear how it sounds.
* Pay attention to the note numbers for different sounds like **kick drums**, **snare drums**, and **hi-hats**.

# Activity: Make your own beat
Try using an interactive rhythm composer to make up your own beat.
Copy the Python code for your beat and paste it into your project.
