# What is Live Coding?
Live coding is a new kind of performance art where musicians use computer code to generate and perform beats in real time for
live audiences. Instead of being hidden away on your computer screen, coding becomes a central part of the performance that gets combined with other elements such as dance, live instruments, vocals, rap, and more. Just as talented musicians dazzle audiences with their technical skills, live coders are virtuoso performers who can take the center stage. Here are a few examples of what live coding can look like, but keep in mind that this is a new genre of performance, and we are only beginning to understand what is possible.

# What You'll Learn
This curriculum consists of a set of activities to give you an introduction to music including a few basic beat patterns,
chords and harmonic structure, and melody and bass lines. Along the way you'll gain experience with introductory coding concepts using the Python programming language.

# What is Python?
* Python is one of the world’s most popular programming languages.
* Python is a text-based programming language, which means you have to type lines of code that tell the computer what to do.
* Professional programmers use Python to make artificial intelligence tools, websites, apps, games, and more.
* With TunePad we’re going to use Python to make music!

# What is TunePad?
* TunePad is a free website where you can make music with Python code.
* TunePad does not make money from advertising and will never share your personal information or email.
* TunePad was created at Northwestern University with funding from the National Science Foundation.

# Get Ready!
In these activities, you'll work with teammates to use Python code to create original music for live peformances!
