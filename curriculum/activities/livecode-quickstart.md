In the next few activities we're going to learn how to perform three basic beat patterns using Python code.
With a little practice you'll be able to get a groove going quickly. Each pattern is customizable,
and we'll show you how to add variety and ornamentation. We'll also experiment with some coding "cheat
codes" that make it even faster to get your audience excited. 

To get started, you only need to know two TunePad functions called `playNote` and `rest`.

# `playNote` Function

You can play a drum sound in TunePad with the `playNote` function.

# Drum Names and Numbers
* TunePad uses numbers to represent different notes and drum sounds.
* Try clicking on each different drum to hear how it sounds.
* Pay attention to the note numbers for different sounds like **kick drums**, **snare drums**, and **hi-hats**.

# `rest` Function

A rest is a way of adding pause or silence to music. 
You can add a rest to your code with the `rest` function.
