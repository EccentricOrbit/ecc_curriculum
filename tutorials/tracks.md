In this activity, you’ll learn how to layer audio loops together to make a full-length song using TunePad’s tracks interface. 

# Start
* Open this link: [https://tunepad.com/project/40743](https://tunepad.com/project/40743)
* Press the **Remix** button.
* Play each of the cells one at a time to hear what they sound like.


# Using Tracks
Click on the Tracks button in the top navigation bar of your project. 
This will open a timeline view of your project. From the timeline, you can:
* Position tracks to start and stop at different times
* Stretch tracks so that they loop
* Duplicate tracks to have more than one start at different times
* Change the volume and stereo pan
