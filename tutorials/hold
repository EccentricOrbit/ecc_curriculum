# Step 1: Create a new Project
Log in and create a new TunePad project at [tunepad.com](https://tunepad.com). Name your project “Mirrors”.

# Step 2: Heartbeat
We’ll start with the heartbeat drums that give the theme its sense of excitement, unease, and anxiety. 
It’s the quickened pulse of a human heartbeat. Create a new Drum cell in TunePad, and use this code:
```python
playNote(1, beats = 0.5)
playNote(1, beats = 0.5, velocity = 50)
rest(1)

playNote(1, beats = 0.5)
playNote(1, beats = 0.5, velocity = 50)
rest(1)
```
The heartbeat sounds like a LUB-dub, LUB-dub. Notice that we use the `velocity` parameter to make the first LUB kicks louder than the second dub kicks.

# Step 3: Ominous Drone
We’re going to add a low, ominous drone that slowly fades in and out of the mix.  
Add a new Keys cell to your project and switch the voice to **Synth → Leads → Searing Lead**.

Use this code for your drone sound:
```python
with lowpass(frequency = [0, 1100, 0], beats = 40):
    playNote(16, beats = 40)
```
This uses an audio production tool called a **lowpass filter** that slowly opens and closes over 40 beats.

# STEP 4: Arpeggio
Add a Keys cell to your project and change the voice to **Synth → Bass → PWM Synth Bass**.

An _arpeggio_ is a chord broken into a series of individual notes played in rapid succession. 
Arpeggios are used everywhere in music and contribute rhythmic, harmonic, and melodic elements to a song. 
The Stranger Things theme uses an iconic arpeggio consisting of a C Major 7 chord played up and then back down in order of pitch.
```python
chord = [ 24, 28, 31, 35, 36, 35, 31, 28 ]
for note in chord:
    playNote(note, beats = 0.5)
```
