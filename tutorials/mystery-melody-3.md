# Help! How do I fix syntax errors?
Here's a quick example of a common syntax error in a TunePad project.  
This oneâ€™s tricky because the problem is actually on line 1 even though the syntax error says line 2.  
The actual problem is a missing right parenthesis on line 1.

```python
playNote(60
rest(1)
```

<div class="error-message">
    <div class="error-name">
        <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>SyntaxError
    </div>
    <div class="error-description">bad input on line 2.<br>rest(1)</div>
</div>
