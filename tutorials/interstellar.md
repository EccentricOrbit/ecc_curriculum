Interstellar features a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer in 2014.
In this short tutorial we'll recreate a simplified part of the melody from the main theme. 
If you're new to TunePad, you might want to try out the [Chicago House Beat](/tutorials/chicago-house) tutorial first.

# STEP 1: Sign In to TunePad
* Go to [tunepad.com](https://tunepad.com) and sign in
* Create a new project and call it "Interstellar"

# STEP 2: Left Hand Part
* In your project, click on the **ADD CELL** button then select **Keys**.
* Change the instrument to **Keyboard â†’ Organ**
* For this part, we're going to play three slow chords (F Major, G Major, A minor)
* We define each chord with a variable and a list of note numbers

```python
FMaj = [ 41, 45, 48 ]
GMaj = [ 43, 47, 50 ]
Amin = [ 45, 48, 52 ]

playNote(FMaj, beats = 6)
playNote(GMaj, beats = 6)
playNote(Amin, beats = 6)
playNote(GMaj, beats = 6)
```

# STEP 3: Right Hand Part
* Click on **ADD CELL** and select **Keys**
* For this part we're going to play a slowly rising pattern that starts at an A note and goes up to E.
* We'll use variables to define each note
* A Python loop creates the pattern

```python
A = 81
B = 83
C = 84
D = 86
E = 88

for note in [A, B, C, D]:
    playNote(note, beats = 1, sustain = 3)
    playNote(E, beats = 2)
    playNote(note, beats = 1, sustain = 3)
    playNote(E, beats = 2)
```
