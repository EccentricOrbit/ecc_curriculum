Twenty One Pilots is one of my favorite artists of all time and I thought it’d be fun to make a TunePad arrangement of one of their tracks! Screen is one of their older songs - it comes from Vessel which is their second album and the first that featured Tyler and Josh. 

Screen is a particularly good choice for TunePad because of its repetition. One of the biggest advantages of making music in TunePad is how easy it is to make something happen over and over again. It’s very formulaic - perfect for Python code. 

Before stepping into how you can re-create Screen in TunePad, take a listen to the original song below!

We’re going to be recreating the intro section which is the foundation for patterns found throughout the piece.

Check out the video of this TuneTorial:
