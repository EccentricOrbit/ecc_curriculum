# Try It
See if you can fix all of the **syntax errors** in this code to reveal the mystery melody.


# What is a Syntax Error?
When you make a mistake writing code, you might get a syntax error. That means Python can't understand what you typed.
These error messages can be confusing, but they also give you hints about how to fix mistakes. 
A syntax error usually has a line number showing where the problem is.
