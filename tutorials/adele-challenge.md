# Challenge
Adele is sad because someone wrote code that looks like this for her song, *Someone Like You*
```python
playNote(45, beats = 0.25)
playNote(49, beats = 0.25)
playNote(52, beats = 0.25)
playNote(49, beats = 0.25)
playNote(45, beats = 0.25)
playNote(49, beats = 0.25)
playNote(52, beats = 0.25)
playNote(49, beats = 0.25)
playNote(45, beats = 0.25)
playNote(49, beats = 0.25)
playNote(52, beats = 0.25)
playNote(49, beats = 0.25)
playNote(45, beats = 0.25)

# and on and on for over 60 lines of code!
```

* Can you think of ways to *simplify* this code? To make it easier to read and understand?

# What to do
1. Start by logging into TunePad and opening this project: <a href="{{ project }}" target="_blank">{{ project }}</a>.
<a href="{{ project }}" target="_blank">
<img src="/images/splash/adele-splash.jpg" alt="" width="180px" style="margin: 1rem 4rem"></a>

2. Make sure to hit the **REMIX** button.

3. Then try to *refactor* the code so that it sounds the same but is shorter and easier to understand.  
There's no one right way to do this, and there are many possible improvements you can make.

4. If you're not familiar with *Someone Like You* by Adele, you can watch the music video here.
