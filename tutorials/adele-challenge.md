# Challenge
Adele is sad because someone wrote code that looks like this for her song, *Someone Like You*
Can you think of ways to *simplify* this code? To make it easier to read and understand?

# Hints
Your goal is to try *refactor* the code so that it sounds the same but is shorter and easier to understand.  
There's no one right way to do this, and there are many possible improvements you can make.

If you're not familiar with *Someone Like You* by Adele, you can watch the music video here.
