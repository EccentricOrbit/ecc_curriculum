# Introduction - My Method to Recreating a Song
When I really like a song, I usually listen to it on repeat for hours, and after a while, I notice that every single song I listen to follows a certain pattern, or is organized in a similar way. I later on learned that this pattern is called song structure. Song structure is essentially splitting up a song into different parts, and repeating certain parts to keep the piece organized and make the song memorable long after someone has listened to it. 

Songs are typically made up of these parts: 

**Verse:** A unit that is usually composed using the "home key", or the key that the song originally starts with. If there are lyrics to the song, this is the part of the song that tells a story and rhymes. You can usually tell if you are listening to a verse if the melody is similar to another part of the song but consists of different lyrics and beats.

**Chorus:** This is usually the melody that repeats several times throughout a piece, and the lyrics and notes are usually unchanging. Song writers usually use the chorus as a chance to establish their primary point or message of the song. 
Interlude: Think of the interlude as the glue of the piece. Usually this is used when a song is connecting one melody to another, especially if the two melodies are quite different. This section of the song helps the listener transition smoothly from one idea/melody to another. 

**Bridge:** A specific type of interlude that is seen right before the final verse or chorus. Unlike the interlude, this is a unique section in a piece, and helps prepare the listener for the final sections by having a contrasting melody to keep them focused. 

**Coda:** The coda is usually the concluding passage of a piece. Think of it as the conclusion, or finale of the piece. 
Knowing the song structure of a piece is really helpful when trying to recreate a song. We can think of each part of a song as a function, and then repeat the function when the certain part repeats so you don't end up accidentally rewriting melodies.

# The Breakdown 

### Structure

Now that we know the parts to a song, here is the structure of Somewhere Only We Know: 

    intro / verse 1 / chorus / verse 2 / chorus / interlude / bridge / chorus / interlude / coda   

As we can see, the chorus repeats three times, the interlude repeats twice, and there's two verses. 

We also know that verses are usually really similar as well. If we listen closely to those parts of the song, we could find out what parts are identical between the two verses, and create other tiny functions that we can call again within a verse. 

Therefore, we actually don't need to write the entire song note by note to recreate the whole piece- we only need to write about half of it. 

### Key 
One last thing before we jump in: we need to know the key of the piece. 

A key is a group of pitches that is  reused over and over again in a music composition. These pitches together form a scale. 

The key of this piece is A Major, and the scale would look like the following:

    A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A   

As you can see, there is an A in the beginning and end of the scale. If we wanted to continue writing what comes after A, it would essentially be a repeat of this same pattern. These 8 notes combined form an octave. Now that we know what the notes would be, we can translate the numbers that make the sounds of those notes into them. We can what the scale would sound like below:
