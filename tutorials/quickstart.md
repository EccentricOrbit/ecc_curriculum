# Welcome to TunePad
TunePad is an online learning platform for creating music with the Python programming language.
TunePad was developed at Northwestern University with funding from the National Science Foundation.
It's free for everyone to use, and we will never sell your personal information.

# How it Works
TunePad projects consist of a collection of **cells**.
Cells can include text and images, or they can include playable musical instruments like the piano below.
To play an instrument in TunePad, you write short snippets of Python code using the **`playNote`** function.

# Try It
Here's an emebedded TunePad project.
The first cell is programmed to play four notes on the piano keyboard. 
Press the â–¶ button below to hear how it sounds.
