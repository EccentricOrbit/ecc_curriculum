# Welcome to TunePad
TunePad is an online learning platform for creating music with the Python programming language.
TunePad was developed at Northwestern University with funding from the National Science Foundation.

        <li><a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> is one of the most widely-used programming languages in the world.</li>
        <li>Python is easy to read and write, which makes it a popular choice for beginners.</li>
        <li>It’s also powerful, which makes it a good choice for professionals.</li>
        <li>Python is used for data science, artificial intelligence, web development, art, music, and video game development.</li>
        <li>Python is a “text-based” language, which means that you type code instead of dragging blocks.</li>

# How it Works
TunePad projects consist of a collection of **cells**.
Cells can include text and images, or they can include playable musical instruments like the piano below.
To play an instrument in TunePad, you write short snippets of Python code using the **`playNote`** function.

# Try It
Here's an emebedded TunePad project.
The first cell is programmed to play four notes on the piano keyboard. 
Press the ▶ button below to hear how it sounds.
