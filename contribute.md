# How to contribute a TunePad Tutorial

We welcome your contributions!   
Please feel free to [email us](mailto:support@tunepad.com) for more information on publishing your lessons, activities, videos, covers, and original music on [learn.tunepad.com](https://learn.tunepad.com).   

If youâ€™re feeling adventurous, you can also contribute directly to our open source repository by following the instructions below.

## Step 1: Clone the GitHub repository
* Visit our [github repo](https://github.com/EccentricOrbit/ecc_curriculum) and make a clone of the main branch.
* Create a [new branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) for your local changes.

## Step 2: Install 11ty
We use a static site generator called [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) to publish our learning resources. To install 11ty:
```sh
cd <my-project-directory>
npm install @11ty/eleventy --save-dev
npm install @11ty/eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight --save-dev
npm install --save-dev pagefind
```
<br>

## Step 3: Run the development server
```sh
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```
<br>

Test your setup by opening [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in a web browser. You should see the landing page.

## Step 4: Create your tutorial page
* Make a copy of the file `tutorials/stranger-things.md` and save it in the `tutorials` folder
* Let's say you called your new file `tutorials/`<mark>`my-tutorial.md`</mark>
* Edit the [frontmatter](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-frontmatter/) of your new file to change the highlighted fields below.
