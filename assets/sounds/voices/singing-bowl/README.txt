- For Decent Sampler

My partner noticed my facination in sampling and knew I had a love of ringing sounds. She bought me a singing bowl for my birthday this year. It has a wonderful ring and I thought it would make a good instrument. I sampled the bowl in my bathroom (quietest room in the flat!) with a Tascam DR-40x in XY mode. I used a soft felt beater. It took around 45 minutes in total to get the necessary takes, a curious cat, called Luna, was not helpful! Processing of samples was done in Audacity v3.4.0 where I carried out noise reduction and trimming.

I have set the usable range from C1 to C7. It could possibly be stretched a little further down but within these six octaves the best sound is to be had. Feel free to extend it if you know how to edit the .dspreset file. I managed to include eight velocity layers and 5 round robins.

If you find it useful or use it in any works, I'd love to hear about it - Please feel free to drop me a line: steve@sonuslucis.com
